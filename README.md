# START Hack 2022 - SWITCH Case 

### Case Introduction - the Problem Statement
A student's journey through the higher education system is complex and characterized by a jungle of hurdles, questions, decisions, offerings, systems, and tools. Universities want their students to succeed and make their services and content accessible as easily as possible. The user experience should be digital, mobile-friendly, and intelligent throughout. Given a hypothetical secure, government-backed electronic student identity (let's call it Â«edu-IDÂ» ðŸ˜‰) in the form of a basic cryptographic wallet app focused not just on the students current engagement with a specific university, but a companion for life including continued education and careers of any type: How can we simplify and enrich the student's lifelong learning journey? 

We offer two ways of approaching the problem: one technical and another with an emphasis on the studentâ€™s perspective. 
- Approach Â«TechnologyÂ»: We are looking for novel and surprising ways to integrate technology into such a base wallet. The aim is to create a rich ecosystem of services and make the platform robust, secure, and scalable. The resulting system should be open and partnership-friendly in both digital and analog settings. We want to remove friction for users and administrators alike. We seek to allow for innovative ways of transactions, e.g., offline authentication and usage, peer-to-peer transactions, password less tech. You might also go crazy on Machine Learning, VR/AR, blockchain, cryptography, wearables, IoT, smart city and intelligent building technology. 
- Approach Â«Studentâ€™s perspectiveÂ»: We are looking for an app that facilitates the overview and easy use of the literally hundreds of services, tools, logins, events, and datapoints in both digital and analog settings that are needed to enable successful and joyful studies. 

The solutions you propose in both approaches can either be broad (think Â«Super AppÂ» like WeChat) or very specific â€“ solving just one or very few students needs in a novel and comprehensive way. 

Itâ€™s important that your solution centers around the electronic ID & base wallet and enriches the ecosystem on that foundation tech layer.

### Further Information
Use case assumptions:
- The base wallet and electronic ID are provided by SWITCH â€“ the Swiss NREN.  
- For all concepts and prototypes you can assume that every student in Switzerland has this ID and wallet on their smartphone. 
- The users will be students in the higher education system in Switzerland â€“ Bachelor, Master, PhD, post-graduate (e.g., CAS, DAS, MAS, MBA).  
- Users will be in all age groups and demographics. 
- The services mainly will be provided by the universities or public institutions like libraries, research institutes etc. 
Business case assumptions:  
- The base wallet is free of charge. We can see a mixture of free and paid services on the platform. 
- Please propose business models according to your solution.
