# START Hack 2022 - SWITCH Case 

## Case introduction
A student's journey through the higher education system is complex and characterized by a jungle of hurdles, questions, decisions, offerings, systems, and tools. Universities want their students to succeed and make their services and content accessible as easily as possible. The user experience should be digital, mobile-friendly, and intelligent throughout. 

Given a hypothetical secure, government-backed electronic student identity (let's call it [Â«edu-IDÂ»](https://www.switch.ch/stories/The-SWITCH-edu-ID-success-story/) ðŸ˜‰) in the form of a basic cryptographic wallet app focused not just on the students current engagement with a specific university, but a companion for life including continued education and careers of any type: **How can we simplify and enrich the student's lifelong learning journey?**

**We offer two ways of approaching the problem: one technical and another with an emphasis on the studentâ€™s perspective.**
- **Approach Â«TechnologyÂ»**: We are looking for novel and surprising ways to integrate technology into such a base wallet. The aim is to create a rich ecosystem of services and make the platform robust, secure, and scalable. The resulting system should be open and partnership-friendly in both digital and analog settings. We want to remove friction for users and administrators alike. We seek to allow for innovative ways of transactions, e.g., offline authentication and usage, peer-to-peer transactions, password less tech. You might also go crazy on Machine Learning, VR/AR, blockchain, cryptography, wearables, IoT, smart city and intelligent building technology. 
- **Approach Â«Studentâ€™s perspectiveÂ»**: We are looking for an app that facilitates the overview and easy use of the literally hundreds of services, tools, logins, events, and datapoints in both digital and analog settings that are needed to enable successful and joyful studies. 

The solutions you propose in both approaches can either be broad (think Â«Super AppÂ» like WeChat) or very specific â€“ solving just one or very few students needs in a novel and comprehensive way.

## Further information
**Use case assumptions**:
- The base wallet and electronic ID are provided by SWITCH â€“ the Swiss NREN.  
- For all concepts and prototypes you can assume that every student in Switzerland has this ID and wallet on their smartphone. 
- The users will be students in the higher education system in Switzerland â€“ Bachelor, Master, PhD, post-graduate (e.g., CAS, DAS, MAS, MBA).  
- Users will be in all age groups and demographics. 
- The services mainly will be provided by the universities or public institutions like libraries, research institutes etc. 

**Business case assumptions**:  
- The base wallet is free of charge. We can see a mixture of free and paid services on the platform. 
- Please propose business models according to your solution.  

Some of the many use cases weâ€™d like you to look at and possibly solve with your application for students: 
- Find the right course of study at the right university more easily 
- Get a handle on the multitude of accesses, tools, platforms, and communication channels of the university: e.g., Badges & other means of campus entry, WLAN/Intra-/Internet, remote access, course plans and offline/online content, Office and collaboration tools, software, cloud storage, filesharing etc.  
- Keep track of curricula, exams, events, grades, evidence, projects, internships, certificates, transcripts, and degrees. 
- Enhance student mobility: Arrange guest studies and studies abroad. Easily transfer ECTS study credits.   
- Assess cost of living, find a part-time job, find scholarships, find housing, access public transportation  
- Organize life alongside studies: e.g., university sports, discounts, get to know culture and people, build a professional network, learn languages

## Judging criteria
Itâ€™s important that your solution centers around the electronic ID & base wallet and enriches the ecosystem on that foundation tech layer.
